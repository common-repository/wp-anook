Add an anook widget to your website and share your profile live, with ease.

== Description ==
This plugin will over time integrate anook into your website; showing your follower counts, latest posts and other information. This plugin will evolve whilst the API does.
This is a new plugin branched from the Anook Badges plugin which was originally purely for showing a badge.

Anook is a gamers social platform: http://anook.com

I would just like to note that all images used in this plugin are rightfully directly from anook.com for continuity in the house style. I have no made any of them, just used them.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the plugin into the 'wp-content/plugins/' directory
1. Activate the plugin in the plugins menu
1. Add the shortcode (Eg. [anook user="surdaft"] / [anookFollowers username="surdaft"]) or widget to your blog

== Screenshots ==
1. An example of the 2 types of output that will be shown.
2. User badge
3. Nook badge
4. Game badge
